## General Information
The automated parking system was created to solve people's problems when parking their vehicles. The project's goal is to display a single-vehicle in a specified parking place, therefore streamlining the process. This may be implemented by detecting and recognizing the license plate and keeping a parking slot database. It will also make it easier for parking lot guards to issue tokens to car owners.

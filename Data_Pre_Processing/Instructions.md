This is where we will be working on the Data Images. Here we are expected to Pre-process the Images for the ML Model to achieve higher accuracy and eliminate the unnecessary and non contributing Information in the Images. Here you will reducing the noise of the Images and correcting the Angles of the Images so that the contour where the Number Plate is present is better visible for the ML Model to be applied on.
